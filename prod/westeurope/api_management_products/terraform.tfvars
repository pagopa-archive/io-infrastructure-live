            - Only the <forward-request> policy element can appear within the <backend> section element.
            - To apply a policy to the incoming request (before it is forwarded to the backend service), place a corresponding policy element within the <inbound> section element.
            - To apply a policy to the outgoing response (before it is sent back to the caller), place a corresponding policy element within the <outbound> section element.
            - To add a policy position the cursor at the desired insertion point and click on the round button associated with the policy.
            - To remove a policy, delete the corresponding policy statement from the policy document.
            - Position the <base> element within a section element to inherit all policies from the corresponding section element in the enclosing scope.
            - Remove the <base> element to prevent inheriting policies from the corresponding section element in the enclosing scope.
            - Policies are applied in the order of their appearance, from the top down.
